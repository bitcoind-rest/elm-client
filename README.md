# Elm API client

The REST API can be enabled with the `-rest` option. The interface runs on the same port as the JSON-RPC interface, by default port `8332` for **mainnet**, port `18332` for **testnet**, and port `18443` for **regtest**.

## Overview
This API client was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the [swagger-spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-spec) from a remote server, you can easily generate an API client.
